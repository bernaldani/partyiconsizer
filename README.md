## Installation
1. Download the addon and extract the folder.
2. Copy the extracted folder into your World of Warcraft `Interface/AddOns` directory.
3. Launch World of Warcraft and ensure the addon is enabled from the AddOns menu.

## How to Use
1. After logging into the game, open the world map.
2. A small button with a glowing icon will be located next to the map filter button on the top-right of the map.
3. Click the button to open a slider that adjusts the size of the glowing effects for party and raid members.
4. Move the slider to your desired icon size, and the party icons will update in real-time.

## Slash Commands

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, ensure that the addon is installed correctly and that it is enabled in the AddOns menu before entering the game. If the problem persists, try reloading your UI using /reload in the chat.

## Known Issues
The slider may occasionally not register the smallest size correctly. If this happens, release the slider at its minimum value (16) to ensure the blips are properly resized.
Some visual effects may not appear correctly in very crowded areas or when the world map is zoomed in too much.
